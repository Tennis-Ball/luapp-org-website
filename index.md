Lua++ is a revolutionary, fast, safe, type-based programming language based off of Lua 5.1. We loved Lua syntax but hated the fact that it was slow and did not have real [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Lua++ inherits all of the great features of Lua and patches all of its inconsistencies.

If you are interested in this project and would like to take a deeper look at it, feel free to navigate through our web pages (located on the left of your screen). You will be presented the syntax of Lua++ and much more. If you are a real curious critter and want to look at the source code of our project, you can click _View the Project on GitHub_ located on the left of your screen. You will be sent to the main repository of the Lua++ project.

## Performance 
Lua++ drastically outperforms any version of Lua. With various compiler optimizations and a custom bytecode format, it's almost impossible to go wrong with Lua++. We have implemented a strict compile-time type checking system that provides the user with a safe development environment. Not to mention, Lua++ also has a multitude of linter passes that analyze your codebase and notify you of any inconsistencies.
