Lua++ is a revolutionary, fast, safe, type-based programming language based off of Lua 5.1. We loved Lua syntax but hated the fact that it was slow and did not have real [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Lua++ inherits all of the great features of Lua and patches all of its inconsistencies.
